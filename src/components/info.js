            <p>Wellspring Spa is located in the small mountain town of Ashford, WA, about a 90 minute drive from Seattle. Plan on unplugging, as there is limited phone service at Wellspring, but there is plenty to do. Take time to explore one of the venueâ€™s multiple hiking paths, check out the labyrinth or waterfall, relax in the saunas and hot tubs, we will have full access to the grounds all weekend. </p>
